Predicting house prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. 
It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based
on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between 
variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind
of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering
and the number of independent variables being used.
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) 
based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out
a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.



Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, 
which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models,
typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting 
methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. 
Gradient boosting is one of the most powerful techniques for building predictive models.
